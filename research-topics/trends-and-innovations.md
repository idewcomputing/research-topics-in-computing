# Trends and Innovations

You’ll conduct research to learn more about the history of computing, current trends in computing, and emerging innovations in computing. Then you’ll share your research findings to help people better understand how developments in computing technology impact society.

Select a research focus from the choices below, and then follow the [research assignment instructions](../research-assignment.md).

## Research Focus 1

Research a historical development in computing that was important:

* What was it? \(Also, as applicable: When was it developed? Who developed it? Where was it developed? How was it developed?\)
* How was it related to previous work, and how was it innovative?
* Why was it an important development in computing?
* What was its impact on society?

## Research Focus 2

Research a current trend in computing that is important:

* What is it? \(Also, as applicable: Who is using it? Where is it being used? How is it being used?\)
* How is it related to previous work, and how is it innovative?
* Why is it an important trend in computing?
* What is its impact on society?

## Research Focus 3

Research a recent or emerging innovation in computing that will be important:

* What is it? \(Also, as applicable: Who is developing it? Where is it being developed? How is it being developed? When might it become fully developed or more widespread?\)
* How is it related to previous work, and how is it innovative?
* Why will it become an important innovation in computing?
* What might be its impact on society?

## Research Focus 4

Propose your own research into the past, present, or future of computing. Be sure to have your teacher approve your research questions.
