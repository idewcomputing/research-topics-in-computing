# Research Introduction

![](.gitbook/assets/technology-connections.jpg)

Besides learning how to create technology solutions, it's also important to understand the broader context of how computing impacts society.  For example:

* How do new developments in computing technology affect society?
* What are the social and ethical concerns with the use \(or misuse\) of technology?
* What career pathways are available in computing?

You’ll conduct research to learn more about certain topics in computing. Then you’ll share and discuss your research findings with other people.

**CHOOSING A TOPIC:**  Your teacher will identify which specific research topic\(s\) you should research, as well as the deadline for completing and presenting your research findings.
