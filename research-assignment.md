## Conducting Research

Here are some guidelines to follow when conducting research to gather information:

* **Be sure to use appropriate information sources:**
  * The source should be credible and unbiased.
  * The information should be current, relevant, and accurate.

* **Be sure to create a citation for each information source:**
  * You can use the [Citation Machine](http://www.citationmachine.net/apa/cite-a-website) to create citations for different types of sources.
  * Use APA style for your citations.
  * Include your citations in your research report.
* **Avoid plagiarism of other people's writing and ideas:**
  * Paraphrase your research findings in your own words.
  * Use quotations when directly using specific phrases from sources.

* **Avoid copyright infringement of images or other media:**
  * Create your own images or other media
  * Use images or other media that allow reuse or modification \(e.g., [search for media with a Creative Commons license](https://search.creativecommons.org/)\).
  * Understand the requirements for [fair use](https://owl.purdue.edu/owl/research_and_citation/using_research/strategies_for_fair_use.html) of copyrighted works for educational purposes.

## **Report Format**

* paper or blog post
* poster or infographic
* data visualization
* video
* podcast
* another format of your choice \(with approval from your teacher\)

## Sharing Report
